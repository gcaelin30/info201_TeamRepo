Team Project for INFO 201 Technical Foundations:
Project Requirements and Expectations:

Summary

A few weeks into the quarter, you will form teams to complete this challenge.  This is your final project, and each team can decide what they want to build.  More than anything, this project is an opportunity to stretch your skills by diving into a dataset that you find important/interesting.  As long as you meet the requirements below, the direction of your project can be quite flexible.

At the end of the quarter we will have a project fair, at which all the teams will show off what they did to the rest of the class. So do good work and build something impressive. Show off what you've learned, and make something you're really proud of. Take the time to design and build something that you'd be excited to show others and include in your portfolio.
Requirements

What exactly you build is up to your group, but it must meet the following requirements:

   Create an interactive platform using R.  This could be a report, slideshow, or interactive visualization (preferably compiled into a webpage for enhanced accessibility)
    Choose a dataset of sufficient complexity to explore.  This doesn't mean it has to be Big Data, but it should either be of notable size (more than a few hundred observations), or complexity (more than ~5 features of each observation)
    Demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the important features of the dataset.  High-level insights (important descriptive information, major trends, notable outliers, etc.) should be prominent in your resource.  Statistical analyses may be included if appropriate
    Devise a visual representation of your data (i.e., chart, map, etc.).  Ideally, this should be an interactive visualization with ability to interact with the interface (hover, click, drag, etc.), or change the data being displayed (i.e., the chart responds to a set of controls, such as which data is being displayed)
    Tailor your resource to a specific target audience.  The way you frame your solution for a scientific versus general audience is quite different

# Project Description

## What is the dataset you'll be working with? Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.   

The dataset that my group, Existential Crisis Corp, decided to work with is the combined public historical crime data for the city of Seattle. We chose this particular dataset because we wanted to create a type of interactive heatmap of crime changes throughout the time periods that we were able to find. The data was compiled by many organizations working in tandem with the Seattle Police Department, with the purpose of rapidly addressing crime hotspots in the city. However, the website states that “In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, offense reports will only be located to the ‘beat’ level. Location specific coordinates will no longer be provided.” We will be looking at data from a 10 year period, spanning from 2008 to 2018.These datasets were created by the City of Seattle Police Department and made available for public use. We were able to access it through this website: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-76bd0
In addition, this data is used in meetings such as SeaStat for strategic planning, accountability, and performance management.

## Who is your target audience?   

Our target audience is anyone who is curious about the evolution or spread of crime in Seattle. Our main target audience will be the people that live in Seattle or perhaps want to locate to Seattle. This product will be useful to organizations involved in the strategic planning of crime prevention. Other organizations, not just the Seattle Police Department, could use the data to analyze patterns and trends over time, and formulate strategies for engagement in high frequency areas.   

## What does your audience want to learn from your data? Please list out specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.   

Seattleites can learn how the crime in Seattle has evolved over the years given.
1) Where has the crime rate increased in the city since 2008?(Maxwell)
2) What is the frequency of a given type of crime in a certain neighborhood, in a certain year?(Josh)
3) What is the highest occuring crime for a certain year?(Roy)
4) What is the pervasiveness of the various sexual assault crimes in Seattle throughout the years?(Godgiven)
