# Project Description: 

**The dataset** that my team, Existential Crisis Corp, decided to work with is the combined public historical crime data for the city of Seattle. We chose this particular dataset because we wanted to create a type of interactive heatmap of crime changes throughout the time periods that we were able to find. The data was compiled by many organizations working in tandem with the Seattle Police Department, with the purpose of rapidly addressing crime hotspots in the city. However, the website states that “In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, offense reports will only be located to the ‘beat’ level. Location specific coordinates will no longer be provided.” We will be looking at data from a 10 year period, spanning from 2008 to 2018.These datasets were created by the City of Seattle Police Department and made available for public use. We were able to access it through this [website](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-76bd0)
In addition, this data is used in meetings such as SeaStat for strategic planning, accountability, and performance management.

## Our target audience:

Anyone who is curious about the evolution or spread of crime in Seattle. Our main target audience will be the people that live in Seattle or perhaps want to locate to Seattle. This product will be useful to organizations involved in the strategic planning of crime prevention. Other organizations, not just the Seattle Police Department, could use the data to analyze patterns and trends over time, and formulate strategies for engagement in high frequency areas.   

## What can our audience learn from out data?

### Seattleites can learn how the crime in Seattle has evolved over the years given.
1) Where has the crime rate increased in the city since 2008?
2) What is the frequency of a given type of crime in a certain neighborhood, in a certain year?
3) What is the highest occuring crime for a certain year?
4) What is the pervasiveness of the various sexual assault crimes in Seattle throughout the years?
